## Light Mode Improvements
We've made the following changes to improve light mode appearance:

1. Changed bg-gray-50 to bg-gray-100 in body for less stark background
2. Added gradient backgrounds with blue/indigo tones rather than plain white
3. Updated the hero car section with blue/indigo color scheme
4. Added more texture with subtle grid patterns
5. Improved message container contrast and shadows
6. Added gradient buttons for more visual interest

## Commands for Light Mode Debugging

## Light Mode Fix Plan

1. Review and fix these remaining areas:
   - Update message bubble colors for better contrast
   - Improve welcome screen title gradient in light mode 
   - Ensure all text is readable in light mode
   - Add more subtle texture and depth to backgrounds

## Next Steps for Polish

1. Mobile Improvements:
   - Confirm all touch targets are at least 44x44px
   - Test scrolling behavior on iOS and Android
   - Verify safe areas are respected

2. Desktop Improvements:
   - Add hover effects for interactive elements
   - Optimize layout for larger screens
   - Consider adding keyboard shortcuts

## Design Principles

- Use gradients rather than flat colors for more depth
- In light mode, prefer blue/indigo accents to pure white/gray
- Ensure at least 4.5:1 contrast ratio for text
- Add subtle texture (grid patterns, noise) to break up large spaces
- Use shadows and blur effects for elevation
