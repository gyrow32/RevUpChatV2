# Components Directory

This directory contains all React components used in the application, organized by their purpose:

- `ui/`: Reusable UI components (buttons, inputs, cards, etc.)
- `layout/`: Layout components (headers, footers, navigation, etc.)
- `chat/`: Chat-specific components (messages, input, etc.)
- `providers/`: Context providers and wrappers

## Best Practices

1. Keep components focused and single-responsibility
2. Use TypeScript for all components
3. Include proper prop types and documentation
4. Follow the naming convention: PascalCase for components
5. Place related components in subdirectories when they form a group
