# Library Directory

This directory contains utility functions, hooks, and other shared code:

- `utils/`: Utility functions and helpers
- `hooks/`: Custom React hooks
- `api/`: API client functions and endpoints
- `types/`: TypeScript type definitions
- `constants/`: Application constants and configuration

## Best Practices

1. Keep functions pure and focused
2. Document all functions with JSDoc comments
3. Include unit tests for utilities
4. Use TypeScript for all code
5. Keep types in the `types` directory
6. Use constants for magic strings/numbers
